Among the list of realistic biomes are Yosemite Cliffs, Shield, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. Highlands and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking Volcanic Peaks and discover the beautiful Desert Oases.</p> <p>While realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical Moonlight Grove and Amethyst Rainforest, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the Scarlet Mountains. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious Mirage Isles, or even the elusive and nostalgic Alpha Islands. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.</p> <p>If you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the Underground Jungle is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like Infested and Fungal Caves are overgrown with spiders and fungi!
