## About

An up in the difficulty of the final boss fight of Minecraft.

This datapack/mod gives the Ender Dragon many more attacks, some of which can be devastating. It also adds boss music, to add that final boss feel. The Ender Dragon even has a second phase when she reaches half health!

Plus, instead of a wimpy 200 health, the Ender Dragon now has 500 health, making it a lot harder.

Let the fight begin.

## Features

After the dragon reaches half-heath, she will become Mad. When she becomes Mad, she will respawn 3 end crystals and be able to use Mad attacks. She can only become Mad once, even if her health goes above half again.

### New Attacks


##### Basic Attacks

- **Enderwrath:** Force endermen to attack random player.
- **Zombification Surge:** Summon end zombies.
- **Enderflare Barrage:** Shoot fireballs that explode.
- **Perchbind:** Force the dragon to perch. (Replaced with another fireball attack when dragon is Mad)

##### Mad Attacks

- **Celestial Shard:** Teleport to random end crystal location.
- **Lightning Cascade:** Strike lightning on everyone (if you are moving, the lightning will appear where you were a second ago.).
- **Anvilstorm:** Summon anvils 20 blocks above everyone (more visual flare planned).
- **Jeans Guardian:** Spawns miniboss (Miniboss has to be killed before you are able to continue the Ender Dragon fight.).
