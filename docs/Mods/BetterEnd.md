## About

BetterEnd adds new biomes into the End. Each biome has its own atmosphere, resources and mobs. The sky will have a fresh look with purple nebulas and stars. All biomes have custom music (by Firel), sounds and effects to make them alive and interesting to explore. BetterEnd has a custom End generator and custom structures for the Central Island. With our new generator End islands will have different shapes, terrain, will be on different height. Inside islands you can find caves with unique resources.
