## About

With the theme of archeology being introduced in the Minecraft 1.20 "Trails & Tales" Update, it has quickly become clear that Mojang sadly only took a small step into the big world that is archeology. Discover artifacts & fossils by encountering new structures that'll enhance your adventure and exploration!

## Features

- Fossils: Go on an expedition and collect Fossils with unique abilites!
- Artifacts: Gather them to craft & identify powerful ancient Enchantments!
- Structures: Encounter structures with traps, fossils, loot & more!
