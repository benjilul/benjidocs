## <div><b>About</b></div>

Ad Astra! (translation: "To the Stars!") is a space mod for Fabric and Forge with a focus on technology, travel and exploration. We've got everything you need to become an astronaut: rockets, space suits, space stations and machines. Why not take a stroll on the Moon? Build a self-sustaining bunker on Mars? Go mining on Venus? The entire Solar System, better yet, Milky Way, is at your disposal!

   - Five celestial bodies: The Moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury and Glacio, in two different solar systems. Each planet expresses a distinctive flair, with specific mobs and unique materials.
   - Vehicles: Four rocket tiers for interplanetary travel and a rover for traversing the rough, alien terrain ahead.
   - Technology: Standard processing machines and generators, along with oxygen generation and distribution, fuel refining, water pumping, cable, fluid pipes and a rocket workbench.
   - Building: Spruce up your builds with over 250 building blocks, ranging from planet-specific bricks and stones to space station deco and metal plating.
   - An in-game guidebook, explaining everything you need to progress and prosper in Ad Astra!
